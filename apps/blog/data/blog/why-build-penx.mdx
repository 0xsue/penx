# Two important motivation

## Truly Own Your Data

This is the most important motivation of it.

What's the "Truly Own Your Data"?

- Own your data in local, in spite of the cloud.
- No vendor lock-in, open source data schema
- Privacy protection, no one can see your data except for you.
- Version-controlled data backups, never lost your data

## DAO-Driven

Generally, the development of note-taking software products is dominated by two main approaches:

- **Company-Driven**: Examples include Evernote, Notion etc.

  > The issue with Company-Driven approaches is that the interests of the company and the users may eventually diverge.

- **Individual-Driven**: Examples include Joplin, Trilium, etc.

  > The problem with Individual-Driven approaches is that they tend to be too fragile and unsustainable in the long run.

For PenX, it will be DAO-Driven, meaning that PenX is not led by a company or indie hacker.

DAO-Driven has many advantages:

- Community-Driven Innovation
- Incentivizing Participants
- Global Participation
- Transparent Decision-Making

Many open-source software projects rely on passion-driven contributions. Contributors often don't receive sufficient rewards for their work in creating and maintaining pen-source software. This lack of incentives has resulted in poorly maintained, vulnerable, or low-quality software.

By **DAO-Driven**;, We aim to build an open-source software that is sustainable in the long run.
