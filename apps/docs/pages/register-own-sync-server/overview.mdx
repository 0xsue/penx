# Overview

In PenX, Our philosophy is **Own Your Data**, there is no centralized database to store user's notes.

## What is Sync Server?

**Sync Server** is sync your notes across devices instantly.

**Sync Server** is not a service or database that aim to store user's data. Its main purpose is syncing data, rather then store data.
