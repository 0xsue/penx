# Prerequisites

Before deployment a sync server, prepare these:

- `DATABASE_URL`: A Postgresql database URL, you can get it from: https://supabase.com

- `REDIS_URL`: A Redis URL for realtime sync between multiple devices, you can get it from: https://upstash.com

- `TOKEN`: PenX sync server, get it from: https://app.penx.io

Of course, you can also start your own Postgresql and Redis service, for example:

```bash
version: '3'

services:
  redis:
    image: redis
    container_name: redis
    command: redis-server --requirepass {{password}}
    restart: always
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'

  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: {{DB_NAME}}
      POSTGRES_USER: {{USER_NAME}}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: {{PASSWORD}}
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes:
      - ./postgres/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```
