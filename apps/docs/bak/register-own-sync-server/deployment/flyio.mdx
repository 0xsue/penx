# Deploy to Fly.io

You can deploy PenX sync server to [Fly.io](https://fly.io).

## Prerequisites

Before deployment, Please read the [Prerequisites](/register-own-sync-server/deployment/prerequisites) carefully.

## Configure your Fly app

Save the following snippet into a file named fly.toml somewhere on your computer, changing the app name as you see fit:

```bash
# See https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/ for information about how to use this file.

app = "penx-sync-server" # you can use your app name
primary_region = "atl"

[build]
  image = "penxio/penx-sync-server:latest"

[env]
  DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://..."
  REDIS_URL = "redis://..."
  TOKEN = "..."

[http_service]
  internal_port = 4000
  force_https = true

  [[http_service.checks]]
    interval = "10s"
    timeout = "1s"
    grace_period = "20s"
    method = "GET"
    path = "/"

[[vm]]
  cpu_kind = "shared"
  cpus = 1
  memory_mb = 1024
```

## Deploy!

in your terminal, navigate to the directory where fly.toml is located and run `fly launch --copy-config`:

```bash
fly launch --copy-config
```

## Real world example

When deployed successfully, you should get a URL like:

https://penx-sync-server.fly.dev

Now copy this server URL to PenX server settings.

## Upgrade

If new version PenX sync server is released, you can upgrade it easily by `flyctl deploy`:

```bash
flyctl deploy
```
